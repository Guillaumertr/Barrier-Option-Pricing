# 🧠 Barrier Option Pricing – Advanced Monte Carlo Simulation

This notebook implements a robust and accurate pricing method for **barrier options** using **Monte Carlo simulation** combined with a probabilistic modeling of path extrema.

---

## 🧱 Motivation

Barrier options are exotic derivatives whose payoff depends not only on the final price of the underlying asset, but also on whether the asset has breached a certain barrier level during its life. Examples include:
- **Up-and-Out Call**
- **Down-and-Out Put**
- ... and their "In" counterparts.

A naïve Monte Carlo approach would simulate standard asset paths and simply check, at each discrete time step, whether the barrier has been breached. However, this method is flawed:

> 🔍 **Key Insight:**  
> Due to discrete time steps, a path that should have crossed the barrier might not be detected as such — especially when the crossing is small or occurs between two time steps.

This notebook avoids that inaccuracy by:
- Simulating the **joint law** of the asset and its **running maximum (or minimum)** using known properties of **Brownian motion with drift**.
- Applying **analytical formulas** for the probability of crossing the barrier within a time interval, enabling far more precise estimation of the crossing behavior.

✅ This approach yields **much more reliable pricing**, especially for tight barriers or short maturities where discrete sampling fails.
